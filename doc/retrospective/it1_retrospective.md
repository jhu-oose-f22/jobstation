# Retrospective for iteration 1

## Delivery

1. Refined our SRS. We added Groups section and set it as the main feature. After that, we modified our SRS.
2. Designed class diagram of all three parts. Designed user faces including Groups, Tracking, and Discuss sections. 
3. Implemented basic functions in discuss section: user registration and login, post and view posts.

## Challenges:

1. All members are not familiar with React.js. So we developed the front end without implementing React.js which needs to be reconstructed in the next iteration.
2. There are too many features in the three sections. We may need to cut some features in two features and focus on Groups.

## To-do list

1. Implement user story in the Groups section.
2. Rebuild the front end with React.js.
2. Adding some features in the Forum section.
